        <p>Formerly the dean faculty of health sciences, <strong>University of Ife, Nigeria (now Obafemi Awolowo
            University)</strong>, Prof. Grillo's early research work, on the embryogenesis of the pancreas, which was
          mostly conducted at his laboratories in Nigerian universities, showed that world class biomedical research was
          feasible in developing countries. He later explored role of infections in the pathogenesis of such problems as
          calcification of the pancreas, a syndrome that is relatively common in Nigeria.</p>
        <p>He was professor of anatomy at the <strong>University of Ibadan</strong> until 1966 before moving to Ife.
          Here he created an innovative programme in which the medical curriculum was coordinated with the training
          programme of other health workers. He applied this experience when he was asked to establish a new medical
          school in Sierra Leone. Professor Grillo was in great demand by institutions in developing countries who
          sought his guidance, and as consultant to the World Health Organisation <strong>(WHO)</strong> he advised
          institutions in Liberia, Sudan, and Malawi. For many years he was president of the <strong>Association of
            African Medical Schools</strong>. He was an editor of the <strong>Nigerian Journal of Science</strong> from
          1967 to 1975 and for some years was editor of <strong><em>IBADAN</em></strong>, the academic journal of the
          University of Ibadan.</p>
        <p>Outside medicine he was a talented artist—some of his paintings were exhibited—and a keen musician—he played
          the church organ and gave piano and organ recitals.<a target="_blank" id="tribute-link"
